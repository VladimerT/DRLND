# Project 1: Navigation 

Note: This is for project submission for the Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree program.



Original Project description with the environment installation is given at the Udacity [GitHub](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/p1_navigation).



The network was trained for 2000 episodes, but we can see that the network was able to resolve the environment within 1000 epochs.
